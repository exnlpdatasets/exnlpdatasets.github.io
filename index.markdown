This website collects datasets for Explainable NLP (ExNLP). It started with the paper ✨ [Teach Me to Explain: A Review of Datasets for Explainable NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12060) ✨, and we hope it will evolve as new datasets are collected.

Datasets are grouped by explanation type: 

* [Highlights](https://exnlpdatasets.github.io/highlights/)
* [Free-text Explanations](https://exnlpdatasets.github.io/freetext/)
* [Structured Explanations](https://exnlpdatasets.github.io/structured/)
